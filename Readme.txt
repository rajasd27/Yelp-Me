*********************************** CONFIGURATION ***********************************

== API Accounts ==

In order to use the Yelp Me application, a user must have registered an account with the Mapbox API.  The steps to create a mapbox account and generate the access tokens is given below.   

https://www.mapbox.com/help/how-access-tokens-work/#mapbox-account

Now copy the access token to the OAuth_Keys.json file.


== Authentication File ==

Once account is setup with the MapBox API services, the access tokens will need to be stored in JSON format in a file called OAuth_Keys.json.  This file is placed in the same directory as the YelpMe.py. A sample file containing dummy keys currently exists in the YelpMe zip file. The file must contain the following key value pairs all at the initial level in the JSON file.

    KEY         VALUE
    Token       Mapbox API access token


== Data Subdirectory ==

The data sub-directory must be located in the directory where the python code resides. This folder, contains files about businesses (restaurants) and business review (restaurants reviews) for different businesses across the United States in JSON format. Along with this, the data contains other JSON files which include the state and city latitude and longitude, cuisine file and food file.
